## Launching and Optimizing WordPress with Amazon Lightsail
About: Amazon Lightsail is one of the easiest ways to get started with AWS. It offers virtual servers, storage, databases, and networking, plus a cost-effective, monthly plan. 
This project shows you how to launch and configure a WordPress instance on Lightsail. It includes steps to connect to your instance by using SSH, signing in to your WordPress website, create a static IP and attach it to your instance, creating a DNS zone, and map it to your instance.
